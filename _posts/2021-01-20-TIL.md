## Socket Error  
  
WRITE ERROR’s happen when attempting to write on a connection, but it fails because of a closed socket on the server.  
  
READ ERROR’s happen when attempting to read on a connection, but it fails because of a closed socket on the server.  
  
# Python API  
  
just JsonResponse string message test on localhost, that is all  
  
used python Django

# Node.js with FASTIFY API  
  
simple print hello world,

Fastify is ten times faster!!  
  
but I am super interested in Nest.js right now !!!!  
  
# Here is Nest.js !

Nest is little bit slower than Fastify ,  
  
it works with Express and also u can choose Fastify when u need it .  
  
and  it has really good architecture, like Django, If we follow the rule and frame of Nest,  
  
It will be super good fast enough and robust server!  
  
## **Performance**  
  
There are some threads in stack overflow where people are comparing a “hello world” performance benchmark between Express and Nest. Since Nest itself uses Express underneath, it’s really stupid to compare these two. To get a lot better performance, Nest gives an alternative way to change the underneath framework implementation from Express to [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) (another node framework).  
  
```jsx
npm i --save @nestjs/platform-fastify
```
